The roles of these key properties in the Flexbox layout model are:

1.justify-content: This property aligns flex items along the main axis of the flex container. It helps distribute extra free space when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It can take several values, including `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly`.

2.align-items: This property controls the alignment of all flex items on the cross axis, which runs perpendicular to the main axis. It can take several values, including `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, and `baseline`.

3.gap: The `gap` property in CSS is a shorthand for `row-gap` and `column-gap`, specifying the size of gutters, which is the space between rows and columns within flexbox. It creates a fixed space between adjacent flex items.

4.flex-direction: This property establishes the main axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. It can take several values, including `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, and `column-reverse`.

5.flex-wrap: The `flex-wrap` property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it also defines the direction that lines are stacked. It can take several values, including `nowrap`, `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`.
